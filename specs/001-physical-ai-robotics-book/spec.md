**Feature Branch**: `001-physical-ai-robotics-book`  
**Created**: 2025-12-06
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "for book Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Understand Core Concepts (Priority: P1)

As a reader, I want to understand the fundamental principles of Physical AI, so that I can grasp the core concepts of how AI interacts with the physical world.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational knowledge required to understand the rest of the book.

**Independent Test**: A reader can explain the difference between virtual AI and Physical AI and list the three main pillars of Physical AI (perception, manipulation, navigation).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a reader has finished Chapter 1, **When** asked to define Physical AI, **Then** they can articulate the definition clearly.
2. **Given** a reader has finished Chapter 1, **When** asked about the key challenges in Physical AI, **Then** they can list and explain at least three.

### User Story 3 - Explore Sensors and Actuators (Priority: P3)

As a reader, I want to explore the different types of sensors and actuators used in humanoid robots, so that I can understand how they perceive and interact with their environment.

**Why this priority**: This is a key technical area for understanding how humanoid robots function.

**Independent Test**: A reader can identify the primary sensors and actuators on a diagram of a humanoid robot.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a reader has finished Chapter 3, **When** presented with a scenario, **Then** they can suggest appropriate sensors and actuators for the task.
