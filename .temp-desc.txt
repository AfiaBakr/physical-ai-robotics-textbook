# Title:
"Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics"

## Target audience:
Students, instructors, and developers learning AI systems that operate in the physical world, including robotics, embodied intelligence, simulation pipelines, and humanoid robot control.

## Focus:
The foundations and practical pipeline of Physical AI—AI systems that interact with reality—and how to design, simulate, and control humanoid robots using ROS 2, Gazebo/Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac.

# Success criteria

    - Covers ROS 2, Gazebo/Unity simulation, NVIDIA Isaac, VLA   (Vision–Language–Action)
    - Includes 10+ structured chapters aligned with the quarter/week breakdown
    - Includes APA-style citations with 15+ credible sources
    - Reader can understand and reproduce:
        - ROS 2 node architectures
        - Gazebo/Unity physics simulations
